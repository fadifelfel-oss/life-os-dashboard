# NEXT SESSION — UI Build (Sonnet handoff, 2026-07-06 evening)

## Stage 1 — DONE (theme system, R13)

- `shared.css`: `:root` rewritten to Blueprint Dark defaults; explicit
  `[data-theme="blueprint"|"graphite"|"light"]` blocks added, folded in from
  `theme-preview.html`. Derived tokens (`--border-secondary`, `--text-tertiary`,
  `--accent-hover/bg/border`, `--on-accent`, `--text-link`) are computed once
  via `color-mix()` in `:root` — a theme block only overrides ~8 base vars and
  everything else recomputes. Added `--accent-2` (secondary/link color),
  `--font-display` (Space Grotesk / Georgia / Segoe UI per theme), and 3 fixed
  `--swatch-*` reference tokens for the picker UI only.
- `shared.js`: `Theme` object rebuilt for 3-way switching (`Theme.LIST`,
  `.apply()`, `.toggleDropdown()`, `.renderDropdown()`). `g` `l` shortcut now
  cycles all three. Removed the old binary dark/light `matchMedia` listener.
- `index.html`: theme-toggle button replaced with a `.theme-switcher` dropdown
  (reuses the `.ctx-switcher` pattern) showing all 3 themes with swatch +
  checkmark. Anti-flash inline script added to `<head>`.
- **Anti-flash inline script added to `<head>` of all 15 pages that use
  `shared.css`**: index, dashboard, use-cases, skills, models, mcp, keys,
  loops, imagegen, files, graph3d, browser, life-areas, chat, artifacts.
  Reads `localStorage['fb-os-state'].theme` and sets `data-theme` before the
  stylesheet loads — no flash on any of them now, including on a hard
  refresh/direct link (every one of these is a real standalone document, not
  an SPA fragment — `navigateTo()` does `window.location.href`, only
  Dashboard loads inline).
- Fixed hardcoded colors I found while in `shared.css`: `.command-bar` (was
  `#1a1d24`/`#30363d`), `.voice-btn` + `.pulse-rec` keyframe (were raw
  `rgba(247,120,186,...)` etc — now `color-mix()` off `--pink`/`--purple`/
  `--red`), `.btn-primary`/`.fab-capture`/`.capture-modal-actions .btn-primary`
  (`color:#fff` → `var(--on-accent)`), and `graph3d.html`'s `body{background:
  #0d1117}` inline override that was defeating the whole theme system on the
  3D Brain page.
- NUL scan: clean (`grep -rlP '\x00' *.html *.js *.css` — zero matches,
  verified via the Grep tool, not bash — see gotcha below).
- Brace/syntax integrity verified: `shared.css` 280/280 braces balanced;
  `shared.js` verified with `node --check` (copied real content out to a
  scratch file and ran node — passed clean).

## Known gaps / NOT done in Stage 1 (deliberate scope cuts, not oversights)

1. **Three pages are fully off the shared design system**: `kanban.html`,
   `voice.html`, `meetings.html` each hardcode their own `:root` (different
   variable names — `--bg-card`, `--text-muted`, etc. — not `--bg-primary`
   etc.) and don't link `shared.css` at all. The anti-flash script would do
   nothing there. `artifacts.html` is a hybrid: links `shared.css` (got the
   anti-flash script) but ALSO defines its own local `:root` fallback
   (`--bg`, `--bg-card`, `--bg-editor`...) that its body content actually
   uses — so it may not fully respond to the theme switch either. **This is
   real migration work — rewrite these 4 pages onto the shared token names —
   and belongs in Stage 3 (component standardization, "sweep all pages"), not
   Stage 1.**
2. Font self-hosting (Inter/Space Grotesk/JetBrains Mono/Noto Arabic, task
   2.1) is explicitly FABLE's task per UI-MASTER-PLAN, not mine — I wired
   `--font-display` as a variable with web-safe fallback stacks so the actual
   `@font-face` work later is a drop-in swap, but no font files are hosted
   yet.
3. Did NOT do a full hardcoded-color audit of every page's internal `<style>`
   block (each page has its own, some 400+ lines) — only fixed what I found
   in `shared.css` itself plus the one `graph3d.html` body background that
   directly broke theming. Full per-page sweep is Stage 3's job.

## IMPORTANT — environment gotcha discovered this session

**The bash sandbox's mount of `C:\Dev\life-os-dashboard` goes stale and does
NOT reflect edits made via Read/Write/Edit/Grep tools.** Concretely: after
editing `shared.css` and `shared.js` via the file tools, `bash`'s `wc -l`,
`grep`, and `git diff/status/show` on this same folder returned a snapshot
from BEFORE the edits (missing ~180 lines of real content, wrong git diff
stats). The Grep tool and Read/Write/Edit tools ARE reliable (they hit the
real host filesystem). **Verification in future sessions on this repo must
use Grep/Read, not bash, for anything touched via file tools this session.**
If this is still true next session, worth flagging to Fadi as a Cowork/host
sync issue outside this repo's control.

## Pre-existing repo issue (NOT caused by this session — flag to Fadi)

`git status` showed this BEFORE any edits tonight: a staged rename
`use-cases.html -> use-` (truncated filename, looks like an interrupted
`git mv`), staged deletions of `voice-chat.js` and `voice.html` with both
also present as untracked new files, and working-tree modifications to
`command-bar.js`, `models.html`, and `UI-MASTER-PLAN.md` that this session
never touched. This looks like a previous session's git operation got cut
off mid-way. Per the 2026-07-06 hard rule I never ran any `git add`/`restore`/
`checkout` to fix it — needs Fadi (or Hermes) to look at `git status` by hand
before the next commit.

## BUILD ORDER — remaining

**STAGE 2 — Icon sweep (Phase 2.2, per design/ICON-MAP.md):** self-host
`assets/lucide-sprite.svg`, add `.icon`/`.status-dot` CSS (spec already
written in ICON-MAP.md), replace the ~183 emoji in chrome across all pages'
nav/buttons/status — start with `index.html`'s sidebar+mobile nav (highest
visibility), then sweep page headers. Status emoji (🟢🔴🟡) → dot+label
component using `--status-*` tokens (already exist). Leave emoji inside
vault/chat/kanban CONTENT untouched. Log any emoji not in the map's table.

**STAGE 3 — Component standardization (Phase 2.3):** card anatomy
(eyebrow/value/delta/footer, left-aligned), status dot+label everywhere,
designed empty states, sweep all pages — AND fold in the 4-page legacy
migration noted above (kanban/voice/meetings/artifacts onto shared tokens).

**STAGE 4 — Part C ARMS (BUILD SPEC §C1-C4):** `/api/arms` endpoint in
`server.py` (aggregates memory from `/api/wiki` + `_system/registry/*.md`
already seeded in the vault — read all three registry files, they're ready).
Rebuild `graph3d.html`: Rings default layout, Force/Circle/Hex/Rings toggle,
registry side panels, all colors via `getComputedStyle` off the new
`--area-*`/`--status-*` tokens (already in shared.css from tonight).

**STAGE 5 — Hub rebuild** (`dashboard.html` per `design/HUB-LAYOUT-SPEC.md`,
`/api/today` already live) — only if time allows per the original brief.

## Git — I never ran git add/commit/push (hard rule). Exact commands for Fadi:

```
cd C:\Dev\life-os-dashboard
